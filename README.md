Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text.

Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.

Both deliverables can be found in folder "Notebooks and Analysis". Deliverable one is in a notebook titled "part_1_mars_news" and deliverable two is in a noteboom titled "part_2_mars_weather"

Within the folder "Notebooks and Analysis" there is a folder "Graphs" with the graphs saved as png files
